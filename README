Description of Code
===================

The code contained in this distribution uses velocity field models to compute
flow maps. The flow maps form the basis of the computation of the FTLE field.

Only 2D velocity fields are supported:
1) analytically defined field
2) snapshots

Getting started
===============

To run the code, first build the executables as described below. The main
executables are called
1) fmc-gyre, and
2) fmc-snaps

and will be created in the 'build' directory.

Both executables read input arguments, for documentation please refer to the
report (see PDF in report directory)


Installation
============

Requirements:
	C++ compiler

	Google C++ testing framework, version 1.6.0 (to run tests)
		http://code.google.com/p/googletest/

	Doxygen (to build documentation)
		http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/


Building the library and executables:

The default configuration is to compile the code with the GCC compiler. If this
is acceptable, then to build the library and executables, all you need to do is type

	make

from the root directory of the distribution (we will call this <main>). The
library and command-line tools will be generated in the 'build' directory.

To customize the build process for your system, make a copy of the file
'config/make.inc.gcc' and modify it as needed (this file is included by other
Makefiles, and the format is pretty self-explanatory). Save the new file as
<ibpm>/config/make.inc and type 'make' from the root <main> directory, as before.

Building and running the automated tests:
	make test

Building the documentation:
	make doc


Documentation
=============

The documentation consists is in the report, see directory: report
