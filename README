Description of Code
===================

The code contained in this distribution uses velocity field models to compute
particle flow maps. The flow maps form the basis of other calculations, such as,
propogation of Probability Density Functions (PDFs) or computation of the Finite
Time Lyapunov exponent. The velocity field models can be provided by Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) or

[TODO] velocity field snapshot data.

=> For now, only 2D / 3D velocity fields specified by ODEs are supported


Getting started
===============

To run the code, first build the executables as described below. The main executable is called 'main' and will be created in the 'build' directory.

The code reads an input argument to determine the case (doublegyre velocity field)

To run the code for this example:
	cd examples
	../build/main doublegyre

This will initialize the solver with some zero initial condition, and propagate
particles for 150 timesteps, writing ASCII files readable by the Tecplot
plotting software (Gaussian PDFs are written to the file...).


Installation
============

Requirements:
	C++ compiler

	Google C++ testing framework, version 1.6.0 (to run tests)
		http://code.google.com/p/googletest/

	Doxygen (to build documentation)
		http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/


Building the library and executables:

The default configuration is to compile the code with the GCC compiler. If this
is acceptable, then to build the library and executables, all you need to do is type

	make

from the root directory of the distribution (we will call this <main>). The
library and command-line tools will be generated in the 'build' directory.

To customize the build process for your system, make a copy of the file
'config/make.inc.gcc' and modify it as needed (this file is included by other
Makefiles, and the format is pretty self-explanatory). Save the new file as
<ibpm>/config/make.inc and type 'make' from the root <main> directory, as before.

Building and running the automated tests:
	make test

Building the documentation:
	make doc


Documentation
=============

The documentation consists of a user manual (in doc/manual.tex), which describes

[TODO] the main functionality of the code,

as well as detailed documentation automatically generated by Doxygen. 

The user manual is the best starting place for new users, and explains the
format of the geometry files, among other things.

The default configuration for the automatically generated documentation is to
generate both html and LaTeX documentation, but this can be changed by
modifying the file 'doc/Doxyfile'. Once the documentation has been built, the
html documentation (usually the most useful) can be found in
'doc/html/index.html', and the LaTeX documentation can be found in
'doc/latex/refman.tex'.
